# Burn Detection and Classification
* Heal the Burn?
* How We Classified Burn Images

| Type of Burn | Blistering | Appearance | Pinprick test |
|-----|-----|------|---|
| Superficial dermal | Present | Bright red | Sensitive to pain |
| Partial thickness | Blisters are broken | Cream colored | Dullness to pain |
| Full thickness | Absent | Gray/white | No sensation |

### A. Superficial Burn
* injury to the epidermal layer of the skin
* heals within 5 to 7 days
* e.g. sunburn
* blistering present, bright red appearance, sensitive to pain

### B. Partial Thickness Burn
* damage extends up to dermis layer
* severity depends on how much injury the dermis has sustained
* usually leave scars
* blisters are broken, cream colored, dullness to pain

### C. Full Thickness Burn
* destroys epidermis, dermis, and subcataneous layers of skin
* no sensation
* require skin grafts
* blistering absent, gray/white appearance, no sensation
